## Ipsum Below

They asked me if I had a gay poem
So I said “Straight up, no!
“My words don’t deviate between straight lines
My poems don’t mince their words
Or bend
Or make queer little observations”

They asked me if I had a gay poem
So I answered honestly
That, no, I didn’t have any gay poetry
And even if, unthinkably, I did
What would it say about me?
I mean, even presenting the question
Puts me in a precarious position
And how would I even begin to broach the subject
With my own creation?
